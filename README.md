by digby

## Minimum system requiements
8GB of RAM
Stable internet connection

## Starting the Server
Run the "RUNME.bat" script to start the server. If the server doesn't start, proceed to the next section.

## Java Troubleshooting
This modpack requires Java 8. If you've installed the client modpack (or any other pre-1.17 modpack) from the CurseForge launcher on this machine, you should already have the right version of Java installed. In this case the RUNME.bat script should work out of the box. 

If not, you may need to download Java 8. Go to https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp, 
download a Java 8 version appropriate to your OS, and install it. Copy the path to the installation's java.exe; it should look something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_301\bin\java.exe".

Next, open RUNME.bat in a text editor (e.g. Notepad). Replace the path in the second line with the path to your Java 8 install's java.exe, in quotes. Now if you run RUNME.bat, the server should start correctly.
