# Into The Wastes
A hostile survival and exploration modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2
by digby

## Troubleshooting
If the game seems choppy or laggy, increase the allocated RAM to at least 6GB. In the Curseforge launcher: open the Into the Wastes profile, click the three dots in the top right corner, then select Profile Options in the dropdown. Uncheck the "Use System Memory Settings" checkbox, set the slider to at least 6400MB, and click the Done button.

## Installation Notes
Do not under any circumstances update MixinBootstrap or Animania Base. Recent versions contain bugs that prevent the game from starting (MixinBootstrap) and disable custom advancements (Animania).

## Optifine
You will need to install Optifine separately, due to copyright restrictions. Download https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_G5.jar and place the file in the /mods folder.
