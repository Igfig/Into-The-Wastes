Only in a few hidden oases do rains still fall, trees still grow, and the earth still give up its bounty of ores.$(br2)$(bold)This is a modpack about survival.$() Heat and thirst must be carefully managed. Food and natural resources are rare, and must be cultivated, hoarded, and protected from spoilage."

You'll have to saddle up lines of llamas, horse carts, and train cars to transport all of your goods back home; as you become more accustomed to the Wastes, you'll be able to travel farther from home, to even richer lands."

But each oasis means a new ore to mine, a new food to eat, a new animal to tame. Your only option is to keep pushing outwards, blazing new trails to new lands and beyond."
